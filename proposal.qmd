# Background

Recently, exploring and analysing the large network structure data has spared more interest in the health field, particularly within emergency medical services (EMS) and ambulance systems. These systems have an important role in ensuring the transfer is in a timely and effective way, especially for the older population, where the delay could increase the health risk. Older individuals often require a continuous support, including 24-hour case, assistance on the daily task, and medical supervision. Thus, many reside in the residential aged care facilities (RACFs), which are specificly designed to provide these comprehensive care.

RACFs frequently rely on the ambulance servieces to facilitates the transfers of an individual to the hospitals. It can either be an acute emergencies or planned/scheduled medical appointmetns. The increase in demands for these transfers are driven by the population ageing. These put incredibly pressure on the ambulance resources and highlights the need for efficient use.

# Research Plan

## Project 1: Exploring the Ambulance transfers from aged care facilities to hospital

The efficiency of the ambulance transfer is critical in both the case of scheduled and emergency transfer to minimise the use of resources. In th scheduled service, the longer the transfer, the fewer ambulances are available in the systme, which can affect the number of ambulances available during an emergency state. For the emergency case, it directly influences the outcomes of the patient, especially the time-sensitive conditions such as trauma, cardiac emergencies, and strokes. The analysis of the ambulance transfer is there crucial for improving the quality of emergency care, ensuring an adequate number of available ambulances, and strengthening the system. Along with the efficiency, predicting the demand of the ambulace is also important since it allows ther services to plan accordingly in the different scenario.

Instead of just evaluted the transfer pattern by network analysis, a simple data analysis can help reveal some other finding that are usually hidden in the complex network. For example, the transfer distance distribution.
